## About This Repository

This repository contains a collection of tools that I have developed while learning **Bash scripting**. Each tool is designed to automate tasks, making them faster and more efficient, with the power of **AI** to assist where needed. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, these scripts aim to simplify your workflow and improve productivity.

Some of the tools in this repository include:
- **Penetration Testing Tool Installer**: A script to quickly set up essential penetration testing tools.
- **Network device Scanner**: A tool to scan and identify devices on a network.
- **Website Recon Tool**: A tool to perform reconnaissance on websites for security assessments and information gathering.
